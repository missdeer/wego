# WeGo

[简体中文](README_CN.md)

An open source forum system for Gopher community forked from WeTalk and rewritten via [tango](http://github.com/lunny/tango) & [xorm](http://xorm.io).

## Installation

### From source

```
go get github.com/missdeer/wego
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/missdeer/wego
go build
```

Copy `conf/global/app.ini` to `conf/app.ini` and edit it. All configure has comment in it.

The files in `conf/` can overwrite `conf/global/` in runtime.

run `./wego` and then open `http://localhost:9000` in your web browser.

## Static Files

WeGo use `Google Closure Compile` and `Yui Compressor` compress js and css files.

So you could need Java Runtime. Or close this feature in code by yourself.
